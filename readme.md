*Aura* is a fast and lightweight 3D audio engine for [Kha](https://kha.tech/) to ease creating realistic sound atmospheres for your games and applications.

# Features

- Multiple attenuation models for 3D sound
- Mix busses for modifying groups of sounds together
- Doppler effect
- Built-in DSP filters:
  - High-/band-/lowpass filter
  - Haas effect
- Extendable DSP system â€“ easily write your own filters

# Installation

In your project directory, create a folder called `Libraries`. Then, open a command line in that folder and execute the following command:

```
git clone https://gitlab.com/MoritzBrueckner/aura.git
```

Then, add the following line to your project's `khafile.js` (if you're using Armory, you don't need to do this step):

```js
project.addLibrary('aura');
```

# Usage

Load a sound with Kha:

```haxe
kha.Assets.loadSound("MySoundFile", (mySound: Sound) -> {
    // All the code inside {} is executed after the sound was loaded
});
```

Play a sound:

```haxe
import aura.Aura;

...

// Plays the sound `mySound` without repeat on the master channel
Aura.play(mySound);

// Plays the sound `mySound`with repeat on the master channel
Aura.play(mySound, true);

// Plays a sound `mySound` without repeat on the predefined fx channel
Aura.play(mySound, false, Aura.mixChannels["fx"]);
```

Create a `MixerChannel` to control a group of sounds:

```haxe
import aura.channels.MixerChannel;

...

var voiceChannel = MixerChannel();
// Mix the output of `voiceChannel` into the master channel
Aura.masterChannel.addInputChannel(voiceChannel);
```

Add a lowpass filter to the master channel:

```haxe
import aura.dsp.Filter;

...

Aura.play(mySound);

var lowPass = new Filter(LowPass);
lowPass.setCutoffFreq(1000); // Frequency in Hertz

Aura.masterChannel.addInsert(lowPass);
```

2D sound:

```haxe
var mySoundChannel = Aura.play(mySound);

// Some utility constants
mySoundChannel.balance = LEFT;
mySoundChannel.balance = CENTER;
mySoundChannel.balance = RIGHT;

// Set angle in degrees between -180 (left) and 180 (right)
// You can also use Rad(value) for radians
mySoundChannel.balance = Balance.fromAngle(Deg(30));
```

3D sound:

```haxe
var mySoundChannel = Aura.play(mySound);

// Set the 3D location of the sound
mySoundChannel.location.x = -1.0;
mySoundChannel.location.y = 1.0;
mySoundChannel.location.z = 0.2;

// Set the 3D location of the listener
Aura.listener.location.x = 2.0;

// Apply the changes to make them audible
channel.update3D();
```
